        Whenever you find yourself without a move in mind just take a photo of the gameboard 
        (with the side of the board your defending closest to you).
        After you snap your photo we will show you how we understand the board state.
        If you notice anything out of place or the wrong color just tap that location

        This app can be used to help you decide on your best move during a tough game of checkers. 
        Before we look at the checkerboard we will need you to calibrate the camera. 
        To do this, take a photo of the bottom right 4x4 section of the board. The white spaces of this section should 
        be filled with the four different colors of pieces. 
        Your pieces should be in the squares closest to you and the kings should be placed above the pawns.
        Here is an example of what your photo should look like.</string>
