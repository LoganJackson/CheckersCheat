        Whenever you find yourself without a move in mind just take a photo of the gameboard 
        (with the side of the board you are defending closest to you).\n
        After you snap your photo we will show you how we understand the board state.\n

        This app can be used to help you decide on your best move during a tough game of checkers. 
        Before we look at the checkerboard we will need you to calibrate the camera.\n 
        To do this, take a photo of the board so it looks like the example photo shown below.
        Your pawn should be at the top, and your king on the left.
        Your opponents pawn should be on the bottom and their king on the right.
