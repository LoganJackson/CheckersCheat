        and which pieces are yours, we can help you decide on a good move!
        Whenever you find yourself without a move in mind just take a photo of the gameboard 
        (with the side of the board your defending closest to you).
        After you snap your photo we will show you how we are understanding the board state.
        If you notice anything out of place or the wrong color just tap that piece until its the correct color!</string>

        This app can be used to help you decide on your best move during a tough game of chekers. 
        Before we look at the checkerboard we will need you to calibrate the camera. 
        To do this you will need to take a photo of a 2x2 section of the board with pieces centered in each section. 
        Your pieces should be in the squares closest to you and the Kings should be placed in the leftmost squares.
        Here is an example of what your photo should look like.</string>
